Our Video Interview files are stored in an encrypted storage and are protected using time limited shared access signature provided by Windows Azure to protect private blob storage. <br /><br />

We obtain security assurances or certifications from the third parties that we use in providing services to our customers. <br /><br />

Access to your data is restricted on a &apos;need to know&apos; basis and controlled through role based access control mechanism. <br /><br />

Our Website is periodically assessed by third party service providers for security vulnerabilities and we perform periodic penetration testing. <br /><br />

Although this period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with Monjin, it will be retained for so long as necessary for Monjin to respond to any issues arising from your relationship. <br /><br />

When Monjin no longer needs Personal Information, we will destroy, delete, erase or convert it to an anonymous form without any notice to Users. Monjin may delete information including, but not limited to, stored messages, interviews, videos, audio, other content, and records of User accounts without any prior notice to Users.
