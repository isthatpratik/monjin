            Last year, Monjin planted rice and fruit saplings in the fertile
            soil of Phansad in Maharashtra. Adding to the farm&apos;s burgeoning
            fauna, this was our first step in building a greener India. However,
            we did not stop there. Monjin donated 85 smart stoves to the
            villagers of Kharkhardi, also in Maharashtra. These smart-stoves not
            only saved the Kharkhardiâ€™s women from inhaling harmful smoke
            arising from burning wood, but also brought down the quantity of
            wood used to cook each time.
